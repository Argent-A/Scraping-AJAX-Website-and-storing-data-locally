# Scraping-AJAX-Website-and-storing-data-locally

Just a little pet project of mine. I was recently in the market to purchase my own property and I was tired of scrolling and seeing the same listings. I figured I could probably automate my search in Python and email myself whatever listing came out that day. 

The site being scraped is a local real estate website that specializes in the area I'm interested in. It also aggregates data from other real estate agencies within the area.
The site also uses some form of AJAX/Dynamically loaded Javascript, so scraping the HTML data becomes a little more involved than just being able to step through the site's urls. This is because dynamic javascript is able to render the contents of your web session without changing the url you are on. To get around this, this script will use a chrome driver and the python selenium module.

A few things to note when scraping:

- scrape with a proxy vpn just in case.
- have a list of user agents to rotate through.
- Be courteous with the timing of your requests. This code makes about 1 server request every few seconds. 
- Create a cache of the data so that you do not re-scrape data you already have, unless the data has changed.
- If you can scrape in random intervals throughout the day this probably makes it easier on the server.
- Try to scrape during low user traffic times, i.e: overnight
- Check the robots.txt page of the site and do not make requests to the pages that the site is restricting. Check this on "WEBSITE_NAME.COM/ROBOTS.TXT"
